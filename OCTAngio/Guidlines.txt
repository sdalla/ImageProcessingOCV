Great meeting you today. I'm attaching sample images acquired by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA); an original image, binarized image, and skeletonized image. We are looking into methods to quantify the vasculature using such images, these are the methods currently used:
- Percentage of vessel (white) pixels calculated by binarization
- Total length of vessels calculated using the skeletonized image
- Fractal dimension and lacunarity of the skeleton
- Size of the foveal avascular zone (black avascular area in the center) 
- Number of vascular junctions

Would appreciate you ideas into other potential methods to utilize in this regard.

Also, do you think it would be practical to somehow use the background noise present in the center of the image as a baseline for setting a threshold for creating binary images?
